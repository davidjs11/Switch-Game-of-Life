# Switch Game of Life
### A homebrew Nintendo Switch implementation of Conway's Game of Life using SDL 2 and libnx libraries.

To install:\n simply just put the gameoflife.nro file in the ' /switch ' folder of your SD card.
I'd appreciate any feedback, so I can make my code better and improve the game's performance and gameplay.
This is the first version of the project, so it's really basic. I will add more features soon.

Controls:\n
  - A: next iteration (change cell state in edit mode).
  - B: start iterating.
  - L/R: adjust iterating speed.
  - ZL/ZR: zoom out/in.
  - X: enter edit mode.
  - Arrows: move camera.
  - Right joystick axis: move cursor in edit mode.
  - Right joystick button: change theme (only dark and white are available at the moment).
  - Y: disable grid.
  

To do:\n
(soon)
  - Change some aspects from the edit mode.
  - Add UI
  - Save/Load patterns
  - Edit initial table size
  - Redesign the render method
  - Custom themes system
  
(maybe in the future)
  - Add an infinite table
  - Step back
